# [webhook-in-docker](https://github.com/firepress-org/webhook-in-docker)

## What is this?

The simplest usage of **webhook** image is for one to host the hooks JSON file on their machine and mount the directory in which those are kept as a volume to the Docker container. 

## How to use it

<p>

## How to use it

```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /dir/to/hooks/on/host:/etc/webhook --name=webhook \
  almir/webhook -verbose -hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json -hotreload
```

Another method of using this Docker image is to create a simple `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM almir/webhook
COPY hooks.json.example /etc/webhook/hooks.json
```

This `Dockerfile` and `hooks.json.example` files should be placed inside the same directory. After that run `docker build -t my-webhook-image .` and then start your container:

```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=webhook my-webhook-image -verbose -hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json -hotreload
```

Additionally, one can specify the parameters to be passed to [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/) in `Dockerfile` simply by adding one more line to the previous example:

```
FROM almir/webhook
COPY hooks.json.example /etc/webhook/hooks.json
CMD ["-verbose", "-hooks=/etc/webhook/hooks.json", "-hotreload"]
```

Now, after building your Docker image with `docker build -t my-webhook-image .`, you can start your container by running just:

```
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=webhook my-webhook-image
```

## Docker hub

Always check on docker hub the most recent build:<br>
https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/webhook/tags

You should use **this tag format** in production.<br>
`${VERSION} _ ${DATE} _ ${HASH-COMMIT}` 

```
devmtl/webhook:2.6.9_2019-08-29_23H00s56_a54f96b
```

These tags are also available to try stuff quickly:

```
devmtl/webhook:2.6.9
devmtl/webhook:stable
devmtl/webhook:latest
```
